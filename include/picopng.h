/*
decodePNG: The picoPNG function, decodes a PNG file buffer in memory, into a raw pixel buffer.
out_image: output parameter, this will contain the raw pixels after decoding.
  By default the output is 32-bit RGBA color.
  The std::vector is automatically resized to the correct size.
image_width: output_parameter, this will contain the width of the image in pixels.
image_height: output_parameter, this will contain the height of the image in pixels.
in_png: pointer to the buffer of the PNG file in memory. To get it from a file on
  disk, load it and store it in a memory buffer yourself first.
in_size: size of the input PNG file in bytes.
convert_to_rgba32: optional parameter, true by default.
  Set to true to get the output in RGBA 32-bit (8 bit per channel) color format
  no matter what color type the original PNG image had. This gives predictable,
  useable data from any random input PNG.
  Set to false to do no color conversion at all. The result then has the same data
  type as the PNG image, which can range from 1 bit to 64 bits per pixel.
  Information about the color type or palette colors are not provided. You need
  to know this information yourself to be able to use the data so this only
  works for trusted PNG files. Use LodePNG instead of picoPNG if you need this information.
return: 0 if success, not 0 if some error occured.
